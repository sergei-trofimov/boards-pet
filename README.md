# React Education

## About the project
A pet project for improving skills in React/Ract-Router/Redux. The project was created manually (without CRA), by using Webpack.

#### Description
The project has a simple authorization by Firebase. You can create boards, and each board has its own cards. Each card has inputs (text, checkbox, select). Users can dynamically change (create/edit/remove) fields. Each operation affects all cards in the current board. The project also added Drag&Drop for cards, which also affects every card change.
